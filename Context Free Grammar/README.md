ABOUT THE PROJECT!

1) INTRODUCTION:
The project implements basic CFG (Context-Free Grammar), a formal grammar in which every production rule is formed. CFG's are used to describe the structure and formations of sentences, words, and phrases in natural language. They support the natural language of linguists and form the structure of programming language, but our project has been restricted to the natural language of linguistics. 

In my project, English language statements have been parsed. Words will be matched from the corpus from open source dictionaries or URLs to check if the terms and sentences fall on proper grammar. Our project follows the program's supervised learning approach as a general concept because the project judges sentences on sample inputs and some predefined or consistent rules fed in texts to compare the entered text.
