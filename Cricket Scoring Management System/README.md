The Cricket Scoring Management System was made in the early years of my graduation in C programming language in Dev C++ IDE. This project selects the team players, their scores, match status and shows a detailed summary of each player's statistics along with their scores, runs, balls, overs, and wickets, if any. The project also uses filing to back up the player's information in the system's database and save the records.

DESCRIPTION:
A scoring program in which ball by ball scoring will be done while taking inputs from the user of every ball. The user also enters the number of overs he wants in a match. The program will run for both innings. In the beginning, the toss will happen through random guessing. For every over user will have to input the bowler's name, and at the end of the over, the system will display runs, wickets, playerâ€™s current stats (Either batsman or bowler). The program uses a file handling feature to store various information such as runs, wickets, overs, extras and many more. At last, the program will display the winning team and the stats of every player involved (Either batsman or bowler) as a scorecard.

FEATURES:
1. Toss by random guessing
2. Features like No ball, wide ball, ways of getting out
3. Ball by ball scoring and calculation.
4. Match statistics after every over.
5. Match summary at the end of the program.
6. Program automatically stops when a team wins.
